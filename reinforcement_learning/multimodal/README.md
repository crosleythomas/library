| 2017 | [Beating Atari with Natural Language Guided Reinforcement Learning](papers/atari_language_grounded_rl.pdf "We introduce the first deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to beat Atari games with the aid of natural language instructions. The agent uses a multimodal embedding between environment observations and natural language to selfmonitor progress through a list of English instructions, granting itself reward for completing instructions in addition to increasing the game score. Our agent significantly outperforms Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), Asynchronous Advantage Actor- Critic (A3C) agents, and the best agents posted to OpenAI Gym [4] on what is often considered the hardest Atari 2600 environment [2]: MONTEZUMAâ€™S REVENGE.") | Russell Kaplan, Christopher Sauer, Alexander Sosa | Stanford | | Video [1](https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqXNudaL1wY) [2](https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJMF4dfsWZw) [3](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVHjQReKJNs)|
